# Common Errors and Fixes

AERMOD's error messages are terse and its crashes are cryptic. This
page lists the failures pyaermod users hit most often, what causes
them, and which pyaermod helper catches them earlier.

## Input-file generation errors

### "duplicate source ID"

- **Cause:** multiple sources added with the same `source_id`.
- **Fix:** `Validator.validate(project)` will flag this before write.
- **Where:** `validator.py` line ~195.

### "averaging period not supported for pollutant"

- **Cause:** ANNUAL for 1-hour-designed pollutants, or 1-hour for
  ANNUAL-only criteria pollutants.
- **Fix:** check `ControlPathway.averaging_periods` vs.
  `PollutantType`.

## AERMOD runtime failures

### Immediate crash, ERRMSG.TMP has `E101`

- **Cause:** missing input or met file.
- **Fix:** run `Validator.validate(project, check_files=True)` —
  catches this in-process.

### Runs but writes no output

- **Cause:** `RUNORNOT NOT` in the CO pathway.
- **Fix:** `ControlPathway` defaults to `RUN`; if you see `NOT`
  somewhere, that's why.

### "ANNUAL average requested, ran for single day"

- **Cause:** `met.start_*` / `met.end_*` specify a single day but
  AVERTIME includes ANNUAL.
- **Fix:** `advanced_validate(project)` raises an error for this.

### Silent underprediction near the stack

- **Cause:** stack height at or above GEP — AERMOD models no
  downwash.
- **Fix:** use `assess_source_downwash(src, buildings)` to confirm
  it's by design, or lower the stack.

### "receptor outside DEM bounds"

- **Cause:** AERMAP fetched a DEM that doesn't cover all receptors.
- **Fix:** widen the DEM bbox; see
  [`aermap-troubleshooting.md`](aermap-troubleshooting.md).

### Buoyancy-related NaNs in output

- **Cause:** `exit_velocity = 0` but `stack_temp > ambient` — AERMOD
  can't compute momentum flux.
- **Fix:** `advanced_validate` flags this combination as a warning.

## Cryptic Fortran crashes

| AERMOD message | Likely cause |
|---|---|
| `** FATAL ** negative U*` | AERMET produced implausible friction velocity; re-run QA/QC |
| `** FATAL ** bad mixing height` | zic / zim inconsistent with L sign |
| `*** ERROR *** XY array out of bounds` | receptor grid > AERMOD's recompile limit |
| `*** ERROR *** pollutant not recognized` | typo in `POLLUTID` — use the `PollutantType` enum |

## Using the runner diagnostics

When `AERMODRunner.run()` returns `success=False`, capture context
with:

```python
from pyaermod import summarize_failure
print(summarize_failure(result.input_file, working_dir))
```

That prints ERRMSG content plus the tail of `.OUT`, which is almost
always enough to identify the cause without copying files manually.

## Before you file a bug

1. `Validator.validate(project, check_files=True)` — any errors?
2. `advanced_validate(project)` — any warnings?
3. `EPA_APPENDIX_W_2017.check(project)` (or your profile) — any
   regulatory lint?
4. `run_all_qaqc(surface_records)` on the SFC file.
5. Confirm the minimal reproducer is actually minimal — prefer a
   single source over 50 of them.
